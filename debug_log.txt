{"avg_fake_confidence": 61.32, "total_reviews": 7, "fake_reviews": 5, "review_results": [{"review": "I've had these for a little over two months now and they are working amazing and feeling great! For reference, I am a small person who wears glasses and has a sensitivity to loud noises, so if you're in a similar boat, then these will work well for you!Pros:* Comfort: These headphones are really light, but sturdy. They don't put too much tight pressure on my ears or head (which helps when wearing glasses) and don't make me sweat either. They stay on my head pretty well too.* Noise Cancelling: The noise cancellation is pretty good, but that is kind of subjective for people. Most dull noises (like fans, cat fountains, air conditioners, outdoor noises, etc.) will be cancelled out by this when sound is coming through. I can hear people talking if they come in the room, but it's very easy to drown them out and I sometimes will hear them, but not understand them. This won't block out all of the loud noises out there, but it will lessen them considerably. I'm personally fine with this level, but I live in a mostly quiet home. This might be a downside for those with barking dogs, noisy kids, etc.* Quality Microphone: This microphone picks up my voice well and I sound clear and good when I play with friends. It will pick up quite a bit of noise though, even from a distance (like my cat meowing across the house), but I wouldn't say that's the mic's fault and instead my software's noise filtering capabilities. There are probably more things I could do for it or advance settings I can mess with, but for my needs it isn't important and my friends don't mind. A big thing I like is that the microphone piece is detachable, so I can actually get into more comfortable head positions if I want when I'm just by myself. Plus if the mic gets bad, I can just replace one piece rather than the whole headset.* Bluetooth Freedom: I got this so that way I could see what it's like enjoying a cordless lifestyle. I've heard mix things about Bluetooth headphones in the past that were made for computers rather than phones, but I have not been disappointed. It doesn't really have a high range (about maybe 30 feet?) before it starts cutting out here and there, but  I can go to my kitchen or even sit outside and not have any issues. It's really nice being able to grab a quick snack or make a meal and still chat with people instead of having to step away. It would be nice if this had just a bit more range to it, but for now it works.* Low Light Profile: I get that people enjoy RGB colors and all, but when I'm gaming at night, I don't want bright lights affecting my peripherals as I play. The only lighting this headset has is a green power indicator light that is pointed downward and provides minimal light. That might make it a little dull for some, but I'm not bothered by it.* Good Volume Range: These headphones can get pretty loud or quiet (quiet being the important part), which I personally enjoy. I listen to heavy rock or punk music sometimes, and unfortunately that music can get too loud for my liking and I had struggled to find headphones that could get low enough without having to be muted. It's common that I find headphones or earbuds that can't get low enough for the louder music out there, but I haven't had an issue with this one. There is a good balance of being able to get low enough for loud songs, but also high enough for quiet songs.Cons:* Connectivity Issues: Occasionally (but rarely) the headphones might disconnect from my computer even though I haven't unplugged the USB from it. It's not every day, and it's only happened maybe twice now since I've had them. It's never when in active use, just when I want to use them. I can turn them off or charge them and once I'm ready to use them it'll be fine, but this just sometimes happens. However, I don't believe it's entirely the headset's fault, as the same thing happens with my Xbox Bluetooth controller. Might just be a computer issue.* Low-Sound Popping Issues: These headphones seem to struggle with super quiet noises. It feels like instead of these headphones staying on to play any sound that comes, it almost shuts off when there is perceived silence or lags when very faint noises are projected. If you turn up your volume, even just a little, you won't have that issue, but it is something I notice when listening to music. That does mean though that songs that get super quiet and then really loud will probably suck depending on the difference in scale.", "fake_prob": 0.25516843795776367, "real_prob": 0.7448316216468811}, {"review": "I have tried everything. Zone vibe 100, JBL nightfall, steelseries Arctis nova 5p, a Corsair headset I can't remember the name to, etc. None of them (NONE OF THEM) are on the level this headset is.The mic has no business being this good. Near broadcast quality. I use it all day for work and never have battery problems. Someone asked if I was ai recentyl--its that clear--and I work in a noisey call centerThe noise canceling through the software is superb and completely eliminates the need for things like krisp, but you'll need to understand how to use a computer. Not because the companion app is lacking (it is very user friendly) but because of other reasons I won't detail here as they are very specialized.The sound quality is UNBELIEVABLE, I hear an entire new layer to music, it's actually insane. It does lack some bass but that's ok, as it seems other headsets fake the impact of bass with cheap rumble tricks that my simple monkey mind is tricked by. The crispness of the audio is truly purposeful and amazing.It's very comfortable but there's some strain from all day use due to a sort've lacking depth in the overears. For instance, the zone vibe 100 are far more comfortable in weight and overear space that doesn't touch ear cartilage. I use the zone 100 at home due to its comfort, but this headset's audio quality for media is way better.The sidetone (YES, IT HAS SIDETONE) works while the mic has an output source, and it DOES NOT switch to a different audio mode to relay that. This means you can hear yourself while you play music for instance. The sidetone itself is a bit like a walkie talkie in its quality. Very clear, but lacks any meangful mids and is devoid of all lows. Again, this is just for the sidetone. Think phone receiver sound, while the media otherwise plays normal.Overall I am very very impressed with this headset (and I'm a total audiophile snob when it comes to headsets, obviously). Get this headset. Even though you might need a 5 minute break every other hour due to its somewhat lacking overear comfort, you'll truly be amazed by what this headset has to offer.", "fake_prob": 0.6390367150306702, "real_prob": 0.36096325516700745}, {"review": "after like 2 months of using this, don't buy it. that's it!", "fake_prob": 0.9730381965637207, "real_prob": 0.026961812749505043}, {"review": "Acabo de recibir estos aud\u00edfonos. Ten\u00eda unos Razer Kraken (no recuerdo el modelo), pero despu\u00e9s de cuatro a\u00f1os de uso intenso, aunque a\u00fan funcionan, la diadema se rompi\u00f3, as\u00ed que decid\u00ed comprar estos.Llevo apenas dos d\u00edas us\u00e1ndolos y estoy m\u00e1s que satisfecho con la compra. El micr\u00f3fono suena incre\u00edble con los ajustes correctos, pero incluso sin configuraciones adicionales, la calidad es bastante buena. En cuanto al audio, me encanta. Nunca he usado aud\u00edfonos Hi-Fi, que supongo que tienen una calidad excepcional, pero estos realmente se escuchan incre\u00edblemente bien (esto es solo mi opini\u00f3n).He visto que algunos usuarios mencionan que se les rompen, algo que hasta ahora no me ha pasado (y espero que no suceda). Estar\u00e9 atento a su durabilidad.En conclusi\u00f3n, los recomiendo ampliamente por su calidad de audio y micr\u00f3fono. Creo que, con un uso adecuado y sin ser brusco con ellos, pueden durar bastante tiempo.Edit 5 mayo 2025: siguen sin tener ning\u00fan rasgu\u00f1o, de igual manera el audio y micr\u00f3fono son incre\u00edbles, como dije anterior mente con un uso normal sin ser brusco pueden durar bastante tiempo, hasta el momento no he encontrado nada que les falle como comentan algunos usuarios. una compra 10/10", "fake_prob": 0.7417440414428711, "real_prob": 0.2582559585571289}, {"review": "I bought a new monitor, which doesn't have speakers in it (a deliberate choice) so wanted some good headphones that I could use to watch films with and play games with. Read loads of reviews and these were considered the best for the price. Very comfotable on the head and they cut out the surrounding noise amazingly (beware your partner/parent shouting you as you won't hear them!). I use them with my PS4 and have set it up to work on everything, not just games. The quality of the sound is fantastic. I can't fault them at all. The mic just unplugs as well, so if you don't need it, just pop it to one side", "fake_prob": 0.5543071031570435, "real_prob": 0.44569292664527893}, {"review": "I've never had a headset this comfortable, with such a good microphone all in one.
